# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. There are not
likely to be any objections but just in case someone is already working an issue or there is some
non public knowledge about the status of things we want to connect with you so you do not waste any
of your precious time on non contributory work.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.


## Reminders about FOSS

When reporting bugs keep in mind that the people working on it do this unpaid,
in their free time and as a hobby. So be polite and helpful. Reports that
demand, contain insults to this or other projects, or have a general unfriendly
tone will be closed without discussion. Everybody has it own way of working;
What might be the norm for you, might not be for others. Therefore be verbose in
your description.


# Creating a bug report

Please write your bug reports in clear English.

Before creating a bug report:

* Update to the latest version. Check if problem still exists.
* Check existing bug reports, see if it is already reported.
* Read the documentation. Make sure the behaviour you are seeing is a bug.

When reporting bugs include the following information:

* BLT version. blt -v
* BLT configuration. blt -help (in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/))
* Steps to reproduce.
* What behaviour you see.
* What behaviour you expect to see.
* A proper title for others to search for.
* Be exact.

When adding comments to an issue make sure:

* It is relevant to the issue.
* It contributes to solving the issue.
* Use :+1: :-1: emojis instead of replying 'me too' or 'I also have this.'


Issue high-jacking, e.g. adding a request/issue to an existing issue, is very
disruptive.
Please create a new issue, if it is similar it will be marked duplicate.



# Creating a feature request


Before creating a feature request:

* First check the *next* branch, to see if the feature has already been
  implemented.
* Check existing reports, see if it is already requested.

When reporting a feature request include the following information:

* BLT version. (blt -v)
* A clear description of the feature you want added.
* A use-case for the feature.

If possible try to explain how you would expect to use feature.
For example, should it be a configuration option or a hot-key. 

Requesting a feature is no guarantee it will be added but we will
think about it of course.

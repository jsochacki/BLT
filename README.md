**BLT** is a C++ based tool that is aimed at performing automatic list creating for cataloging books, videogames, and other objects that have text regions that are separated with clear and srong boundaries.  In order to use BLT one must only take pictures of the items that they want to catalog in their natural state like the following.

Once you have one of these or a whole set of these just place these in the directory you launch BLT from and run BLT.  THe result will be held in a .csv file in the same directory.  There are similar things for books out there and there are OCR apps but none that I could find that met this need specifically.

# Theory or operation:

  1.	Use Canny edge detection from OpenCV(https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/da/d22/tutorial_py_canny.html) to get the edges
  2.	Draw bounding boxes around each contour https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/da/d0c/tutorial_bounding_rects_circles.html
  3.	Snap each enclosed area to itâ€™s own image file
  4.	Use tesseract-ocr https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract to get the text from each image
    a.	Take an image and use tesseract, run it for all 4 orientations (base, rot 90, rot 180, rot 270) and save the result with the highest score
  5.	Write it all to a file using standard library calls
